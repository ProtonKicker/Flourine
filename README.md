# Flourine
##### Intro:
This printer is not for speed, but all about cost. I want to make the cheapest 3D printer possible, making 3D printing availible for everyone.

The printer is based on the Voron 0, but the linear rails are changed to smooth rods and the mini stealthburner is replaced with a very simple yet smaller toolhead.

In the future, the printer is going to be upgraded. Hopefully, I could make it better while not drastically increasing costs.

##### Status:
v0.9
Right now, the printer prints, but a build is not reccommened at this time. More works needs to be done.
For example, the CAD file have some minor problems at the moment, and the bed wobbles. Yes this printer works, especially considering the price, but make sure that you know this printer is somewhat problematic now.

##### Future plans:
Overall, this printer didn't cost me much but it's kind of crappy. Here's the future upgrades:
- linear rails
    The smooth rods and bearings I used is kind of hitting its limits around 300mm/s, shaking a lot. Linear rails could probably fix that.
- heated bed
    I'm using a piece of unheated glass right now. Sometimes things just won't stick on to it.
- stronger bed gantry
    That 3D printed gantry shakes
- more cooling
    Right now, there's only a cooling fan for the hotend heat sink. Part cooling fans will be added in the future.
- bl touch

Future cost saving measures:
- downgrade to standard hotend
    (right now I'm using a highflow CHT hotend and it's kind of too good for the printer)
- 3D print more of the frame
