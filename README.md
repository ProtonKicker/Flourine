# Flourine 3D Printer

## Introduction
The Flourine 3D printer is designed with cost-effectiveness in mind, aiming to make 3D printing accessible to more people.

## Current Status
- **Version:** v0.9  (a completed version will be v1.0)
- **Note:** The printer is functional but not recommended for building at this time. Minor issues with the CAD files need to be addressed.

## Design Overview
- Adopts Voron 0 X and Y axis motor mount design
- Uses Voron 0 XY plane belt path
- Compatible with stock Voron 0 frame
- Utilizes smooth rods and bearings as a cost-effective alternative to linear rails
- Feature a more compact toolhead

## Work In Progress
- upgrading toolhead cooling
- setting up a good pinter profile
- upgrade to heated bed

## Future Plans

### Upgrades
- **Heated Bed:** Upgrade from unheated glass to improve print adhesion.
- **Additional Cooling:** Add part cooling fans.
- **BL Touch:** Integrate a BL Touch sensor for improved bed leveling. Or maybe a inductive sensor like Prusa.
- **Y axis** add more smooth rods to the Y axis

### Cost-Saving Measures
- **Downgrade Hotend:** Replace the CHC hotend with a standard V6 hotend.
- **3D Print Frame Components:** Inspired by RatRig V-Chonk, print more frame components to reduce costs.

## License
The Flourine 3D printer will likely be licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA**. However, due to the adoption of designs from the Voron 0, the licensing details are still being considered. (I'll figure that out)
