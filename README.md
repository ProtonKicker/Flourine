# Flourine ( a Voron 0.2 inspired 3D Printer)

## Introduction
The Flourine 3D printer is designed with cost-effectiveness in mind, aiming to make 3D printing accessible to more people. It is essentially a Voron 0 fitted with smooth rods and bearings.

## Current Status
- **Version:** v1.0  (a completed version that works)
- **Note:** The printer is functional but further imporvements will be made. Minor upgrades will be published.

## Design Overview
- Adopts Voron 0 X and Y axis motor mount design
- Uses Voron 0 XY plane belt path
- Compatible with stock Voron 0 frame
- Utilizes smooth rods and bearings as a cost-effective alternative to linear rails
- Feature a more compact toolhead

## Work In Progress
- upgrade the bed gantry: split it to serveral parts to be printable on the printer itself

## Future Plans
- **Improve bed leving:** Integrate a BL Touch sensor for improved bed leveling. Or maybe a inductive sensor like Prusa's machines.
- **Downgrade Hotend:** Replace the CHC hotend with a standard V6 hotend (or Bambu hotend).
- **3D Print Frame Components:** Inspired by RatRig V-Chonk, print more frame components to reduce costs.

## License
The Flourine 3D printer will likely be licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA**. However, due to the adoption of designs from the Voron 0, the licensing details are still being considered. (I'll figure that out)
