The printer costs only around **100 USD** equivolent. 3D printing stuff is indeed cheaper in China, and I calculated that a standard voron would only cost around 200 dollars if they are sourced in China, not counting labor and cost for printed parts. Still, since this printer didn't require much parts, it would probably be cheaper anyways, even that it is built in a diferent place.


note that
- costs of screw&nuts not listed. They are relatively cheap and you may already have some
- the cost of printing the plastic parts are not included also, this is because it is hard to keep track of. I will probably include that in future updates
