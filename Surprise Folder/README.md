What is this:
A printer I planned to bring to TCT Asia (tommoror, or mar18th), but failed because of time
I don't have time to finish it

I've already tested the printed parts. They work alright. But the printer? I don't exactly know~

But feel free to print from it. It uses all plastic parts for the frame~
